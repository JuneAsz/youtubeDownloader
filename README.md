# youtubeDownloader
A simple (and probably very, very bad) Python application that downloads YouTube videos and playlists using Pytube and Tkinter for GUI.


How to use? 

Open exe -> Click "Set directory" -> Select preferred directory for the downloads to go to -> Copy link into the large white textbox -> Click download -> enjoy your .webm file!

How to build it yourself if you are afraid of random .exe files from the internet (You should be!) 

Get the code from the .py file and make sure you have PyTube library installed -> Run the code on your preferred Text/Code editor (I use VSCode) -> Open CMD with elevated privileges -> I used PyInstaller to compile the thing into an .exe -> type in CMD "python -m PyInstaller 'nameofthepyfile.py' --onefile", click enter -> enjoy.
